### ARP - Address Resolution Protocol
###### ARP is a communication protocol used for discovering the link layer address, such as a MAC address, associated with a given internet layer address, typically an IPv4 address.

### Route Table
###### Route Table is a data table stored in a router or a network host that lists the routes to particular network destinations, and in some cases, metrics (distances) associated with those routes.

### LAN - Local area network
###### LAN is a computer network that interconnects computers within a limited area such as a residence, school, laboratory, university campus or office building.

### CIDR - Classless Inter-Domain Routing
###### CIDR is a set of Internet protocol (IP) standards that is used to create unique identifiers for networks and individual devices.

### OSI Model - Open Systems Interconnection Model
| Layer | Name | Format | Function | Example Protocol | Address Type |
|-------|--------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| 1 | Physical | Bit | Raw bits on physical medium | TIA-323-F, DOCSIS | N/A |
| 2 | Data Link | Frame | Node-To-Node Communication | MPLS | MAC Address |
| 3 | Network | Packet | Routing and addressing | IP, IGMP | IP Address |
| 4 | Transport | Protocol Data Unit  (PDU) -- Segment | End-To-End Integrity | TCP, UDP | Port |
| 5 | Session | Data | Connection Dialog | SOCKS, RPC | Socket |
| 6 | Presentation | Data | Data Representation | XDR, SMB | Hostname |
| 7 | Application | Data | Interactions with user | FTP | Hostname |

### IP - Internet Protocol (Logical Address)
###### IP is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. An IP address serves two main functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing.

### IPV4
###### IPV4 is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol. It is one of the core protocols of standards-based internetworking methods in the Internet and other packet-switched networks.

### IPV6
###### IPV6 is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol, the communications protocol that provides an identification and location system for computers on networks and routes traffic across the Internet.

### MAC - Media Access Control (Physical Address)
###### MAC address is a hardware identification number that uniquely identifies each device on a network. 

### NIC - Network Interface Controller/Card
###### NIC is a computer hardware component that connects a computer to a computer network.

### DNS - Domain Name System
###### DNS is a central part of the internet, providing a way to match names (a website you're seeking) to numbers (the address for the website).

### DNS Query/Request
###### DNS Query/Request is a demand for information sent from a user's computer (DNS client) to a DNS server. In most cases a DNS request is sent, to ask for the IP address associated with a domain name.

### DNS Resolve
###### DNS Resolve is the process of translating IP addresses to domain names.

### MTU - Maximum Transmission Unit
###### MTU is the size of the largest protocol data unit that can be communicated in a single network layer transaction.

- `ifconfig` - show list of interfaces
- `tcpdump -i en0` - data-network packet analyzer/monitoring dns queries 
- `dig shohoz.com` - querying DNS nameservers for information
- `nslookup shohoz.com` - querying DNS to obtain domain name or IP address mapping
- `telnet 52.74.245.254 443` - connect to a remote host
- `tcpdump -i en0 | grep -i "UDP"`
- `tcpdump -i eth0 dst 52.74.245.254 443` - to see traffic
- `nc -l 8000` - NetCat Web server
